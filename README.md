TravelPlan
==========
- To be able to use this project, you may have to update your sdk. You have to install "Google Play Services" (in the "Extras" category).
- You must import in eclipse (Android/existing android code into workspace) the project at [your_android_sdk]/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib and check "Copy projects into workspace".
- Then make sure that in the properties of the TravelPlan project, in Android->Librairy the path to google-play-services_lib is correct.

- You may have to generate your own API key and replace the one at the end of the AndroidManifest (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start?hl=es#the_google_maps_api_key).
